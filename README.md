This My Math Project V1.0
## Description
Welcome to my project, which is a mathematics project using Ruby. I created this project to assist individuals when they encounter difficulties in solving mathematical problems. I designed this project to be fast, precise, and efficient. Additionally, this project has several execution steps, including:

1. The script will display a banner and menu.
2. The user selects one of the available menus.
3. The user enters the data requested by the script.
4. The script will immediately calculate the numbers entered by the user using formulas.
5. The script will display the results based on the numbers and formulas used.

I designed this script using the Ruby programming language without using any libraries or frameworks (plain). I only added some logic to this project to create fast and accurate results.
